## Getting started

Setup virtual environment:

```
py -m venv env
```

Activate it (assuming Git bash if you're on Windows):

```
source ./env/Scripts/activate // assuming Git bash on Windows
source ./env/bin/activate // assuming Ubuntu or similar
```

Verify that a local `python.exe` is listed with:

```
where python // windows
which python // ubuntu
```

(Run `deactivate` if you would like to leave the virtual environment.)

Install packages:

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify that it works:

```
export FLASK_APP=server
flask run
```

## Getting started web

```
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Random notes

`py -m venv env`

`./env/Scripts/activate` inte den

`source ./env/Scripts/activate`

`py -m pip install pyserial`

`py -m pip freeze`

`where python`

## Todo

- maybe put websocket server in flask server
- maybe export next app as static and deploy it into flask static files
- maybe use travis to build the damn thing and push it to heroku

## HC12 notes

On computer:

```
tail -f /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Or:
```
python read.py
```



On RPI:

```
python3

import serial

ser = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyS0", 9600, timeout=1)

ser.write(bytes("", encoding="utf-8"))
```

List serial ports:

```
(source env/bin/activate)

python list_serial_ports.py
```


## Gamepad

Think this is already installed??

```
sudo apt install python-dev
```


```
source env/bin/activate

python env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/evdev/evtest.py
```

Or:

```
python gp.py
```

### How to use `gp.py`

1. Setup python environment (only if you haven't already):
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```
1. Activate python environment:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install packages (only if you haven't already):
    ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Start gamepad and connect over bluetooth.
1. Check that everything works:
    ```
    python gp.py
    ```
    You should see a lot of prints in the console when using the gamepad controller.
1. Use it in your code:
    ```python
    from gp import GP, ButtonValues, ButtonCodes

    
    def B_handler(value):
        if value == ButtonValues.Press or value == ButtonValues.Hold:
            print('B press or hold')
        elif value == ButtonValues.Release:
            print('B release')

    def my_event_handler(event):
        if event.button_code == ButtonCodes.B:
            B_handler(event.value)
        else:
            print('some other button action')

    my_gamepad = GP(event_handler=my_event_handler)
    ```

### Run Ã…len with SN30 controller over HC12 radio

Follow these steps on your laptop:

1. Activate python env: `source env/bin/activate`
1. Make sure gamepad and hc12 are connected to your laptop.
1. Start python script to initialize gamepad and hc12.
1. In case you have started up stuff on RPi (according to https://github.com/bulingen/learning-ros2#run-%C3%A5len-with-sn30-controller-over-hc12-radio), you should now be able to use the gamepad for steering.

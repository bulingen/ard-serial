## Getting started

Setup virtual environment:

```
py -m venv env
```

Activate it (assuming Git bash if you're on Windows):

```
source ./env/Scripts/activate
```

Verify that a local `python.exe` is listed with:

```
where python
```

(Run `deactivate` if you would like to leave the virtual environment.)

Install packages:

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Verify that it works:

```
python reader.py
```
